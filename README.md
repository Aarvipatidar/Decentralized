# Decentralized To-Do List (Task Manager)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

A decentralized task manager (To-Do List) dApp built using Solidity and Hardhat. Users can create, update, delete, and mark tasks as completedâ€”all on the blockchain. Each task is securely tied to the userâ€™s wallet address to ensure privacy and immutability.

## ðŸš€ Project Vision

To empower users with full ownership and control over their tasks, without relying on centralized servers or service providers. By leveraging blockchain technology, the goal is to build a secure, censorship-resistant, and transparent to-do list application.

## ðŸ›  Key Features

- Add new tasks with unique IDs.
- Mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
- Delete tasks securely from the blockchain.
- Task access restricted to creator's wallet (task ownership enforcement).
- Event logging for task creation, update, and deletion.
- Fully decentralized and verifiable on-chain.

## ðŸ”® Future Scope

- Integration with a frontend using Ethers.js or Web3.js.
- Support for due dates, tags, and task priorities.
- Mobile wallet support (e.g., MetaMask Mobile).
- Social/task sharing features with delegated access.
- IPFS integration for storing larger task metadata.
- Layer-2 support for faster and cheaper operations.
